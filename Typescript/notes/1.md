## Instalation
- install Typescript compiler globally (transforms the .ts code into .js code, pretty much like SASS)
```shell 
npm i -g typescript
```

- install `ts-node` globally as well 
```shell 
npm i -g npm install -g ts-node
```

## First program
- Compile it into .js whit `$ tsc yourFileName.ts`
- run your .js file whit `$ node yourFileName.js`

**This means that the browser can only read JS files, thus you should import the compiled .js file and never directly modifiy it**

## Working whit objects
It's actally not that hard but since any object you create is actually a new data type (like whit Solidity) you need to create type/interface
- type/interface: is like a blueprint of your object (used to specify when you will return/expect as argument an object like that)

```js
type myA = {
  // cannot have 2 whit the same name
  num:number,
  name:string
}

interface myObj {
  // if there's 2 whit the same name: get's overloaded (adds extra props)
  num:number,
  name:string
}

function myFunc(num:int) myObj{
  return({ num, `the num is ${num}` })
}
```

### When type or interface?
- type: should be used to improve readability like in the form example 
```ts
type FormElement = React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>; //readbility :D
  const handleSubmit = (e: FormElement) => {
    // specify that we recieve an event (to cancel the defautl submit behaivour)
    e.preventDefault();
  };
```

- interface: should be used whit objects, since it has different var types inside
```ts

```
